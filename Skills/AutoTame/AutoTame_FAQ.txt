 This macro sets out to automate the task of leveling taming

 Things required?
 a tank pet (I recommend a Rock Guar), Veterinary (Can be dropped once GM Taming)a LOT of bandages.

 What does it do?
 It will look for certain graphics and tame them, once tamed it will rename them to 'killme' and proceed to kill the pet
 Dex skills are not required to kill the tame, but helps. If you are going for a magery build - I suggest having one or two pets
 to assist in killing the tamed pet. Ensure your kill pets + tank pet + tamed pet do not exceed the follower count, otherwise
 they will not obey your commands to kill the freshly tamed pet.

 How do I use it?
 This works very well for single spawns of tames, without any other additional creatures to potentially aggro you
 This is achieved by setting your tank pet in a position where any spawned monsters will be closer to your pet than you.
 Command it to stop, and stand one tile behind/diagonal to it, to ensure that anything that spawns will target your pet
 Where do you suggest I tame these?
 Low traffic areas are best, however in some cases such as Molten Mongbats and Bullvores, their spawns are much easier in dungeons to deal with

 Do I have to tame these creatures?
 No. Feel free to change any graphics to whatever you prefer. I have leveled three tamers with this macro, and have merely placed suggestions to help those who might need it. :)

 Why do Sand Crabs have a very large skill gain window listed?
 Due to these being a very passive creature, and in some very out of the way areas, I find these are worth macroing on over a couple of days. This will GM anat/tactics/weaponskill very quickly, as taming a creature gives Active Skill Bonus. Feel free to ignore this suggestion if you want to go slightly faster.

 Why does the bandage not complete on my tank pet?
 The script was written with 100 Dex in mind, you will need to edit the heal portions with a pause which is long enough for your bandage timer.
