/////////////////////////////////////////////
// UO Steam Taming Macro
// for Outlands
//
// This is a "circle" taming script because it walks you in a circle around
// an aggressive tame, keeping you just out of harms way. To use it,
// start with the mob coming at you from a south-southwest direction (aka your left).
//
// To get an idea of the circle it runs, just run it and target yourself.
//
// Each taming attempt occurs at the "top" of the circle - so it will be normal to run
//
// Why attack the creature? The tames seem to lose interest following you after a while
// so you need to attack them to keep them interested in following :)
//
// How much room do you need? Not much - only about a 10x10 square; but lag and server saves
// will screw up the path a bit - so it ends up being a little larger.
//
// Start in PEACE mode. The War mode toggle is to get you out of attacking your own pet.
//
// v1.0

// * Initial version
